## What is SniffnDetect ?
SniffnDetect is an advance DDOS detector tool written completely on Python3. It will sniff your network for a certain amount of time and identify attacks like:
- SYN Flood Attack
- SYN-ACK Flood Attack
- ICMP Smurf Attack
- Ping of Death
- and many more to come..
After detecting those attack packets, SniffnDetect will also find the source of the attack and provide details of the attacker(s).
